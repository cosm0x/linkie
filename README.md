## Linkie Overview

Linkie is a Dapp that enables users and small businesses to create USDT payment links on opBNB!

## Problem

Users in web3 can share long wallet addresses to receive payments. This is prone to typo error and also inconvenient for users or small businesses who also want to track payments and inventory.

## Solution

Linkie lets users create listings, share links, and receive USDT payments directly to their wallet. It's great for small businesses, donations, and community contributions.
